# Grazioso: Rescue Animal Management System

## Overview

Grazioso is a Java application developed for a college course at Southern New Hampshire University. This project aims to create a rescue animal management system that tracks and maintains records of animals that can be trained as service animals. The system allows users to add new animals into service and keep track of their training progress.

## Project Files

The Grazioso project consists of the following Java files:

1. **Dog.java**: Represents the Dog class, which extends the RescueAnimal class. It contains specific attributes and methods related to dogs used as rescue animals.

2. **Monkey.java**: Represents the Monkey class, which extends the RescueAnimal class. It contains specific attributes and methods related to monkeys used as rescue animals.

3. **Driver.java**: Serves as the main driver class for the Grazioso application. It contains the main method to execute and test the functionality of the rescue animal management system.

4. **RescueAnimal.java**: Serves as the base class for rescue animals. It contains common attributes and methods that are shared among different types of rescue animals.

## Functionality

The Grazioso application provides the following functionalities:

- **Add New Animal**: Users can add new rescue animals to the system, specifying whether the animal is a dog or a monkey. The application prompts the user for relevant information such as the animal's name, age, and type of training.

- **Training Progress**: The application allows users to track the training progress of each rescue animal. Specific methods and attributes in the Dog and Monkey classes handle the training-related functionality.

## Getting Started

To run the Grazioso application, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Java installed on your machine.

2. Compile the Java files using the following command in the terminal:

    ```bash
    javac *.java
    ```

3. Run the application using the following command:

    ```bash
    java Driver
    ```

4. Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the Grazioso application.

## Conclusion

Grazioso serves as a simple yet effective rescue animal management system, demonstrating the fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming in Java. This project was developed as part of a college course at Southern New Hampshire University, providing a hands-on learning experience for the developer in Java programming.

Feel free to explore, modify, and expand upon the Grazioso project to enhance its features and functionality based on your requirements. If you have any questions or feedback, please contact the developer.
